# INTRODUCTION TO VERILOG RTL DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS

A low-level abstraction for representing a design circuit is the Register Tranfer Level. RTL design makes the design process easier for designers by automating it. It translates the functionality of a Hardware Description Languages (HDL)-written design circuit into similar combinational and sequential circuits. Fundamentally, Design is a set of Verilog codes that have intended functionalities to meet the standards. Simulating the RTL design ensures that it adheres to the specifications. A Simulator is used to verify or check the design, whereas a Testbench is used to apply stimuli to the design in order to test its functionality.

##	SKY130 - Sky130 process node and pdk(process design kit) are an open-source packages provided by Google and skywater for 130nm technology.
##	iverilog - Iverilog stands for Icarus verilog, is an open source verilog simulator.
##	GTKWave - GTKWave is an open-source vcd(value change dump) waveform viewer.
##	Yosys - Yosys is an open-source synthesis tool. These are the open-source tools used in the labs for the workshop.

##	ENVIRONMENT SETUP
•	#Steps Followed:
•	//create a directory
•	$ mkdir VLSI 
•	//Git Clone vsdflow. 

The sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop Directory contains the following files: My Lib - which contains all of the necessary library files; lib - which contains all of the standard cell libraries to be used in synthesis; and verilog model - which contains all of the standard cell verilog models for the standard cells in the lib. All of the experiments for lab sessions are stored in the verilog files folder, which includes both verilog and test bench code.

##	GOOD MUX IMPLEMENTATION USING IVERILOG

 2-to-1 multiplexer consists of two inputs D0 and D1, one select input S and one output Y. Depending on the select signal, the output is connected to either of the inputs. Since there are two input signals, only two ways are possible to connect the inputs to the outputs, so one select is needed to do these operations.

##	INTRODUCTION TO YOSYS AND LOGIC SYNTHESIS
The tool Synthesizer (Yosys) is used to convert RTL to netlist. The netlist is a common cell-based representation of the design (in the form of the cells present in the .lib). The design and the netlist file should be same. The optimization stage of the CAD process, where the RTL code is turned into a netlist, is known as logic synthesis. The stimulus should be the same as the RTL simulation's output. The code for the design was written in Verilog, and the usual cell format of the code is netlist. Between the RTL design and the synthesised netlist, the fundamental inputs and outputs will be the same. It means that we can use the same testbench that we used for RTL design.

## Synthesis of Logic
The behavioural representation in HDL form for the needed specification is known as RTL Design.The design is transformed into gates, and the interconnections between the gates are created. This is distributed in the form of a file called netlist. To get the netlist file, we mix the RTL design with.lib and synthesise it.

•	.lib file is a collection of logical modules which includes all basic logic gates. It may also contain different flavors of the same gate (2 input AND, 3 input AND – slow, medium and fast version).

•	SUB MODULE LEVEL SYNTHESIS

When there are several instances of the same module, sub-module level synthesis is favoured. In terms of time, sythesizing the same module multiple times may not be advantageous. Instead, synthesising one module, replicating its netlist, and stitching it together in the top module can be done. This is especially useful in large-scale designs that employ the divide-and-conquer strategy

##FLIP FLOP OVERVIEW
When an input signal changes state in a digital design, the output signal changes after a propagation delay. Singals are delayed by all logic gates. These delays generate expected and unwanted transitions in the output, known as Glitches, in which the output value differs from the predicted value for a brief period of time. When the signals are merged at the output gate, an increase in delay on one line can produce a glitch. In other words, more combinational circuits result in more glitchy outputs that do not settle with the output value.there is a need to store the values called as flop elements. D Flip-flops (aka Data or Delay Flip Flops) are the widely storage elements used to restrict the glitches.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104729600/166182674-4a6a6a59-e040-4acd-b985-3de6dab55845.png)

Flop elements hold a single bit of data and can be in one of two states: 0 or 1. They're sandwiched between the combinational circuits, and the output of the flop changes as the clock edge approaches. Although the input is erratic, the outcome is consistent. As a result, the next combinational circuit will get a stable input, and its output will be predictable and stable.

 RTL codeing of a Flip Flop:
Every flop element needs an initial state, else the combinational circuit will evaluate to a garbage value. In order to achieve this, there are control pins in the flop namely: Set and Reset which can either be Synchronous or Asynchronous.

### Asynchronous Reset/Set:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104729600/166182756-8a4c8889-0ae2-4f47-a467-8b03d587c695.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104729600/166182778-f3c061be-9342-4947-abcc-d4e0a4b994bd.png)

When there is a change in the clock or the set/reset, the always block is evaluated. The circuit is sensitive to the clock's positive edge. The singal q line changes as the signal goes low/high, depending on the reset or set control. As a result, it does not occur on the clock's positive edge and occurs regardless of the time.

### Synchronous Reset:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104729600/166182833-0246c1b4-75a6-496e-8ba7-bd65064636c0.png)

The singal is always waiting for the clock and is set to the D Pin of the flop. The D pin will wait for the clock's positive edge, and if it occurs, the output will alter accordingly. Only posedge clk is included in the sensitivity list.

### Both Synchronous and Asynchronous Reset:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104729600/166182890-48be43e1-fba4-4213-8170-c1034a4b2891.png)

When utilising the Set and Reset control pins, use caution as they may cause race circumstances. The always block is checked for the clock's positive edge and asynchronous reset. The use of else if means that the always block has been assessed due to the clock's positive edge.

FLIP FLOP SIMULATION

# DAY 3 :

## LOGIC CIRCUITS OVERVIEW
Combinational and sequential logic circuits are the two types of digital logic circuits. Combinational circuits are a group of fundamental logic gates whose output is solely determined by the current inputs and do not require any clocks. They produce a basic circuit that can implement sophisticated logic using only logic gates. Sequential circuits are made up of flip-flops, which are memory elements. The output of the circuit is determined by both the current and previous inputs. The output requires clock inputs due to the existence of flip-flops. As a result, they produce a sophisticated circuit that can implement complex logic using memory.


1.) Combinational Logic Optimization Techniques

Logic optimization is a type of logic synthesis that aims to find an equivalent representation of a given logic circuit while adhering to one or more constraints. We perform to squeeze the logic and obtain the most optimal design, which can result in space and power savings. This can be accomplished using either the Constant Propagation Method (for example, Direct Optimization) or Boolean Logic Optimization (ex: K-Map or Quine-McCluskey Methods). The most optimal logic is attained in Constant Propogation by propogating the value of one input to the next step and all the way to the output. Synthesis tools use boolean algebra/K-map reductions to simplify difficult logic equations in Boolean Logic Optimization.

2.) Sequential Logic Optimization Techniques
The continuous propogation method is one of the most basic optimization techniques for sequential circuits. When the D input is tied low in a logic design, the Q pin of the flop should always have a constant value to optimise the sequential logic. Advanced strategies for obtaining a most condensed state machine include: 1) State Optimization, which optimises the underutilised states. 2) Cloning logic is performed during physical aware synthesis (where there may be a significant routing delay if two flops are located far apart). To avoid this, clone a flip flop with a lot of positive slack and meet the timing). 3) Re-timing - the combinational logic is efficiently partitioned to reduce the delay and hence increase the throughput.

As a result, the improved graphical realisation depicts the implementation of a 2-input OR gate. Although an OR gate can be implemented using NOR, this can result in a stacked PMOS architecture, which is not recommended for design. As a result, the OR gate is implemented using NAND and NOT gates (which has stacked NMOS configuration).

the optimized graphical realization thus shows A XNOR C gate being implemented.



### CASE 5: multiple_module_opt.v

Due to the presence of multiple modules, the netlist was flattened before optimizing the logic circuit

### SEQUENTIAL LOGIC OPTIMIZATION

/Steps Followed for each of the optimization problems:
1. To view all optimization files
(ls *df*const*)
2. To open multiple files 
(dff_const1.v -o dff_const2.v)
3. Performing Simulation
4. Load the design in iVerilog by giving the verilog and testbench file names
 (iverilog dff_const1.v tb_dff_const1.v) 
5.To dump the VCD file
(./a.out)
6. To load the VCD file in GTKwaveform
(gtkwave tb_dff_const1.vcd)
7.Performing Synthesis
8. Invoke Yosys 
(yosys)
9. Read library 
(read_liberty -lib ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_-tt_025C_1v80.lib)
10. Read Design
(read_verilog dff_const1.v)
11. Synthesize Design - this controls which module to synthesize
(synth -top dff_const1)
12. There will be a separate flop library under a standard library

(dfflibmap -liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_-tt_025C_1v80.lib)
13. Generate Netlist
( abc -liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_-tt_025C_1v80.lib)
14. Realizing Graphical Version of Logic for single modules
( show )

### CASE 1: dff_const1.v

Although Reset goes low, Q will wait for the clock to go high in order to become high. The flop will be inferred in this design.

As a result, the inferred flip is visible in the optimised graphical realisation. In addition, the design code has a high level of activity.


### CASE 2: dff_const2.v
