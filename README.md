# INTRODUCTION TO VERILOG RTL DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS

A low-level abstraction for representing a design circuit is the Register Tranfer Level. RTL design makes the design process easier for designers by automating it. It translates the functionality of a Hardware Description Languages (HDL)-written design circuit into similar combinational and sequential circuits. Fundamentally, Design is a set of Verilog codes that have intended functionalities to meet the standards. Simulating the RTL design ensures that it adheres to the specifications. A Simulator is used to verify or check the design, whereas a Testbench is used to apply stimuli to the design in order to test its functionality.

##	SKY130 - Sky130 process node and pdk(process design kit) are an open-source packages provided by Google and skywater for 130nm technology.
##	iverilog - Iverilog stands for Icarus verilog, is an open source verilog simulator.
##	GTKWave - GTKWave is an open-source vcd(value change dump) waveform viewer.
##	Yosys - Yosys is an open-source synthesis tool. These are the open-source tools used in the labs for the workshop.

Design module may have one or more primary inputs and primary outputs. However, testbench will not have any primary input or output.

##	ENVIRONMENT SETUP
•	#Steps Followed:
•	//create a directory
•	$ mkdir VLSI 
•	//Git Clone vsdflow. 

The sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop Directory contains the following files: My Lib - which contains all of the necessary library files; lib - which contains all of the standard cell libraries to be used in synthesis; and verilog model - which contains all of the standard cell verilog models for the standard cells in the lib. All of the experiments for lab sessions are stored in the verilog files folder, which includes both verilog and test bench code.

##	GOOD MUX IMPLEMENTATION USING IVERILOG

 2-to-1 multiplexer consists of two inputs D0 and D1, one select input S and one output Y. Depending on the select signal, the output is connected to either of the inputs. Since there are two input signals, only two ways are possible to connect the inputs to the outputs, so one select is needed to do these operations.

•	GTKWave is the waveform analyzer and is the primary tool used for visualization and thereby to check the design functionality.

##	INTRODUCTION TO YOSYS AND LOGIC SYNTHESIS
The tool Synthesizer (Yosys) is used to convert RTL to netlist. The netlist is a common cell-based representation of the design (in the form of the cells present in the .lib). The design and the netlist file should be same. The optimization stage of the CAD process, where the RTL code is turned into a netlist, is known as logic synthesis. The stimulus should be the same as the RTL simulation's output. The code for the design was written in Verilog, and the usual cell format of the code is netlist. Between the RTL design and the synthesised netlist, the fundamental inputs and outputs will be the same. It means that we can use the same testbench that we used for RTL design.

## Synthesis of Logic
The behavioural representation in HDL form for the needed specification is known as RTL Design.The design is transformed into gates, and the interconnections between the gates are created. This is distributed in the form of a file called netlist. To get the netlist file, we mix the RTL design with.lib and synthesise it.

•	.lib file is a collection of logical modules which includes all basic logic gates. It may also contain different flavors of the same gate (2 input AND, 3 input AND – slow, medium and fast version).

•	SUB MODULE LEVEL SYNTHESIS

When there are several instances of the same module, sub-module level synthesis is favoured. In terms of time, sythesizing the same module multiple times may not be advantageous. Instead, synthesising one module, replicating its netlist, and stitching it together in the top module can be done. This is especially useful in large-scale designs that employ the divide-and-conquer strategy

//Invoke Yosys
o	yosys
//Read library 
o	read_liberty -lib ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_-tt_025C_1v80.lib
